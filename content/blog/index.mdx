What is this? Who are you? What are you trying to do?

This project, Sitcom is a project that I am using to learn how a modern app will work (opinionated to X tweets I have been getting).

My name is Billy, a software engineer from Indonesia. What I am trying do here is nothing more than documenting my learning journey of Next.js. I have been looking at React since 2020 but I never really get the chance to use it at my workplace. And I don't try to do a lot of hacking outside of work hours. So I practically neglected it (and I regretted it)

Okay, fast forward to 2023. I am in Sydney, Australia with a Working Holiday Visa with confidence in my skills trying to apply for Software Engineer. Needless to say I am rejected everywhere with no portfolio & nothing to showcase my skills. Stupid, yes i know. Basically bringing fists to a gun fight (worse than knife).

This project is heavily inspired & referencing to [shadcn](https://shadcn.com/)'s projects (both [Taxonomy](https://tx.shadcn.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)). So there will be a lot of similarity.

## What to expect from here on out

I will try to update it regularly of what I have learnt. It won't be everyday update unfortunately since I still am working with weird timings in my current work and sometimes it's just hard to find timing to code. Okay blabla enough. So what's next?

Compared to shadcn's Taxonomy. This feature updates is what comes to my mind.

1.  ~~[Contentlayer]~~(https://contentlayer.dev/). Since contentlayer unmantained by the time of writing, we will go with [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) for our blogging and docs pages.
2.  Authentication with Supabase
3.  Payment Billing with Stripe/LemonSqueezy/Paypal
